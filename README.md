# oit-roman-numeral-challenge
Coding challenge for the OIT Student Programmer job

Assumptions made during project:
1. That the user is not going to try to convert a number larger than 3,999 (this being the largest value possible to represent with the symbols given in the challenge)
2. The assumption that the user will want to continue to convert numbers back and forth until an indicated exit of the program.

Tools used:
1. Programmed in C++
2. Visual Studio 2019 (to ensure it works on Windows)
3. Wikipedia page for Roman Numerals (helped identify further rules on for conversion)
4. Stack Overflow for syntax reminding
